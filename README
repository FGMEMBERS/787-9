This is the new 'official' home of the 787-9 for Flightgear.

After gitorious closed down and former maintainer Omega95 retired, islandmonkey created a repo for the 787-8. He said, 'We'll try to gather open merge requests and improvements from the old gitorious repo here.'
I, Jonathan Redpath, aka Legoboyvdlp, with others edited the 787-8 into a 787-9, in time for the 2016.1 release.
